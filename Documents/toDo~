THINGS TO DO
medium fi mockup (all major pages)
advanced search

better project summaries. Weekly check



when no results, "create a recipe that matches what you are looking for?"


cost
num ingredients
cook time
prep in advance
rating


search by ingredients seperate by comma
ingredients need to be changed to an array or something. This is getting messy and I need them to be seperated out so that I can get number of ingredients for search


go into rates table, query to find rateable_id, use that to find recipe, get avg from rates table using rabeable_id to get the average


Maybe I should just use facets for rating and prep in advance.....
