login pop up instead of whole page   !!
dynamically change sidenav menu when logged in

JQUERY --- on second thought, maybe just javascript so that it's more of my stuff. Maybe.
form validation - validate before they submit stuff "iCheck"
slideshow "slidr"   -- !!
form progress bar "fort"
scroll out drop down menus - "sliding menu" --!!
change notifications - "Alertify" --!!
"jquery file upload"
test how complex a password is "complexify"
searchable drop down boxes "chosen"
"fancy input"
"typeahead"
change scrollbar to hidden page scrolling - !!!
"adipoli"
"jQuery PointPoint" to make login more obvious !!
"hook.js"


It would be best to create my own...but it would look so much more "Capstone" if I use jQuery...herm.....

DEFINITELY WANT
slideshow
scroll out drop down menus
better/interactive notifications
typeahead type thing
point point thingy
hook type thing
