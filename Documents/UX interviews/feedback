1. allrecipes.com foodnetwork.com meals.com
2. Search functionality. Categories (side-dish, beef-dish, vegetarian). User ratings, user comments on how to make them better. Doesn't want to really change these features.
3. Printing a recipe, would be nice to choose what size you want the recipe to be(2 have it, 1 doesn't). It'll say "print full sheet, 4/6 card/ half sheet. All recipes has both of these features. Gives you a serving for many you can make, but you can insert a serving and it'll auto-adjust the measurements.
4. Once you pull up the recipe, there is a box where you put in the number of servings you want to make and click submit. Print should be sidebar. "Print recipe with 3 radio buttons".
5. Laptop (want the recipe up in front while preparing a meal). Laptop with a printer (Desktop). "Chances are, I'll print the recipe so I have it in front of me. Not a tablet user."

BRITT
1. Google it, read descriptions to see what sounds what would best suit needs
2. Option to click to making something vegetarian, idea: make substitutions for vegetarian versions of recipes with meat. Would like to specify toward the top if it's vegetarian or vegan or something. Tags for diabetic-friendly, vegan, gluten-free
3. Alternatives to stuff, make suggestions to make something vegetarian. Suggest a link to a recipe that is similar but vegetarian.
4. Similar recipes at the bottom.
5. Phone and tablet (mobile friendly) Specifically Android.

VENISSA
1. No idea, just google it (SEO) look for specific things she's looking for. Allrecipes.com. Pulling up specific recipes to look at ingredients. Makes up own recipes
2. Screw the forward, just show me the recipes. Site navigation. Search. Same ingredients search. Fix the search engines. Search by cookware, by methods (different methods to cook same item).
3. Don't know, don't go online a lot. Mostly search stuff and different ways to cook things.
4. No change here.
5. Phone or tablet.
