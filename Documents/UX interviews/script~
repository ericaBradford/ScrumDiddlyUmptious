"I am working on a project for my school that will showcase what I have learned and prove that I am ready to work with real companies. I got to pick what my project is going to be, because this is going to be my baby. The project I have chosen is a recipe website that blows all other recipe websites away. I want this website to more accurately help it's users learn and create new and interesting recipes. I want people to be able to expand their skills and knowledge of different ways to make new recipes. This interview is going to help me gain some insight of how this website can be of use to people of all walks of life. This interview is to help me understand how this website can be of use to you and others in similar situations. You don't have to worry, there are no wrong answers for any of these questions. This interview is just to help me better understand how I can make this website worthwhile. I am the only one that will know how you answer any of these questions. Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?"
