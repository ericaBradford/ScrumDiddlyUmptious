covers basics to keep in mind in order to run a seccessful user interview for UX (User Experience) design.

*Let them know why you are doing the interview. Remind them that there are no wrong answers.
*Don't ask leading questions, keep the questions open. 
*Script should only be used to help the conversation.
*Keep it less than an hour.
*Leave time between interviews. Give yourself a hour-hour buffer between interviews to 1.) allow time for over-run and 2.) have time to finish notes and give yourself a break.

*Use Livescribe? Helps for audio recording to double-check things.

*Dress to the level of the interviewee.
*Keep the interviewee comfortable. Refreshments? Little bit of small talk before the interview. Thank them.
*Keep on track. A little bit off track is fine, but make use of their time and your time with them. If it gets to far off track, some something like “That’s really interesting, but what I really wanted to ask about was X”.
*Don't bury your head in your notes. Eye contact when possible.

*Interview people in their natural environment. It'll give insight into how the environment will affect how they use a system.

Watch out for
*distractions. Interviewee might get interrupted by phones, children, emails, ect.
*Personality clues. This can give information about how interviewee organises and remembers info.
*Technology. What they work with helps to determine how to best help them.
*Workarounds. Is the interviewee using workarounds for systems that aren't meeting their needs.

~~~What to do with findings~~~
Mindmapping helps cut through details and identify themes and trends.
