THINGS TO DO
shopping list
current menu
print shopping list


change to password not required to change stuff, yet current password isn't required
devise registration create button padding
update profile logs user out
...or all profile pic stuff? On login isn't saving. Editing logs the user out and requires the password.









On the Current Menu page, a user can add Menu titles(defaults: today's, tomorrow's, the week's, experimental) and delete them.
On Recipe show there will be a drop down listing all the menus a user currently has listed, and a button next to it that says "add to menu".

Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already havese
Auto-adjust the amount needed for the shopping list based on what's above














FATAL!!! when a mod loses their account, any recipe they touched is destroyed as well


active user and inactive user: delete: favorites(broken), rates(second time, it did it for me?), comments, preferences(broken?)
