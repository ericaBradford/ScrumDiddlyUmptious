search: current search method gets recipes that match at least 1 of the conditions. I need something that has to match ALL of the ingredients




cook time	currently set up as "15mins - 10 mins", decide if going to do that or "15 minutes or less"





Multiple shopping lists (today's, tomorrow's, the week's)

On Recipe show, "add to Menu" btn
Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already havese
Auto-adjust the amount needed for the shopping list based on what's above

"Recipes to try" menu (experimentation menu?)
icons on every button?
outline on apple

think through how current menu and shopping list connect together
