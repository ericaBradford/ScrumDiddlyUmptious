THINGS TO DO
medium fi mockup (all major pages)
advanced search
go through ps mockup and document the color hexes

better project summaries. Weekly check



when no results, "create a recipe that matches what you are looking for?"


cost		  need to do comparison "asked <= cost"
num ingredients	  need method to calculate num ingredients. Also need to turn ingredients into array
cook time	  need to do comparison "asked <= cook time"
prep in advance   facet? let's try this one, I guess...
rating		  need method to get rating.


search by ingredients seperate by comma
ingredients need to be changed to an array or something. This is getting messy and I need them to be seperated out so that I can get number of ingredients for search


go into rates table, query to find rateable_id, use that to find recipe, get avg from rates table using rabeable_id to get the average


Maybe I should just use facets for rating and prep in advance.....





New color pallet
Multiple shopping lists (today’s, tomorrow’s, the week’s)

On Recipe show, “add to Menu” btn
Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already have
Auto-adjust the amount needed for the shopping list based on what’s above

Change how ingredients are done (in able to do the math thingy above)
“Recipes to try” menu (experimentation menu?)
