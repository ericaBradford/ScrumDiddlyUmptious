THINGS TO DO
filtering for food preferences, not just specific foods


Monday:
Fill out project summary thingy (it should cover what I did during the week and what I plan to do next week)





back-burner:
promote user to admin
admin can edit users
admin should be able to edit all recipes...(bug)
FIXES
fix reset password
clean up validations "cookTime Cook Time must be blah blah blah"
user-error user does new line instead of seperating filtered foods by comma

Low-fi mockups
user test mockups





FILTERING
go through each recipe
see if any ingredients matches foodsToFilter column for current_user
if it does have a match, don't add
if there is no match, add to recipes to display
