THINGS TO DO
medium fi mockup (all major pages)
advanced search


when no results, "create a recipe that matches what you are looking for?"


cost		  	  need to do comparison "asked <= cost"
num ingredients	  need method to calculate num ingredients. Also                 			    need to turn ingredients into array
cook time	  	  need to do comparison "asked <= cook time"
prep in advance   facet? let's try this one, I guess...
rating		  need method to get rating.


search by ingredients seperate by comma
ingredients need to be changed to an array or something. This is getting messy and I need them to be seperated out so that I can get number of ingredients for search


go into rates table, query to find rateable_id, use that to find recipe, get avg from rates table using rabeable_id to get the average


Maybe I should just use facets for rating and prep in advance.....
