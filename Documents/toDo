On the Current Menu page, a user can add Menu titles(defaults: today's, tomorrow's, the week's, experimental) and delete them.
On Recipe show there will be a drop down listing all the menus a user currently has listed, and a button next to it that says "add to menu".

Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already havese
