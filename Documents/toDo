shopping list



when no results, "create a recipe that matches what you are looking for?"


num ingredients	  	need method to calculate num ingredients. Also                 			    	need to turn ingredients into array
cook time	  	need to do comparison "asked <= cook time".......redo how do cooktime?




search by ingredients seperate by comma
ingredients need to be changed to an array or something. This is getting messy and I need them to be seperated out so that I can get number of ingredients for search



Multiple shopping lists (today's, tomorrow's, the week's)

On Recipe show, "add to Menu" btn
Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already havese
Auto-adjust the amount needed for the shopping list based on what's above

"Recipes to try" menu (experimentation menu?)
icons on every button?
outline on apple

think through how current menu and shopping list connect together
