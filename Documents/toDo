shopping list



search: current search method gets recipes that match at least 1 of the conditions. I need something that has to match ALL of the ingredients


when no results, "create a recipe that matches what you are looking for?"


cook time	  	need to do comparison "asked <= cook time".......regex find hr or hour or hrs or hours and take the number(s?) in front of it and times by 60, then add to number(s?) in front of min or mins or minute or minutes





Multiple shopping lists (today's, tomorrow's, the week's)

On Recipe show, "add to Menu" btn
Menu(previously bookmarks) automatically adds ingredients to list
Way for people to specify how much of that ingredient they already havese
Auto-adjust the amount needed for the shopping list based on what's above

"Recipes to try" menu (experimentation menu?)
icons on every button?
outline on apple

think through how current menu and shopping list connect together
