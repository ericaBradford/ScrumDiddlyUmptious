are the pks auto incrementing?
are the ids in the form 'idUsers'?
Does the table start with a lower case and end plural?

are the foreign keys singular, have the table name in them, and match up with the others table col(idUsers not idOwners)?
Are the foreign keys in the form 'fk_idUser_Tablename'?
Are the foreign keys set to cascase on Update and on Delete? 

all bool values are of type binary in the database. A 1 is true and a 0 is false. That being said, in the food table there are a bunch of bools. They will be centered on if a food DOESN'T contain an element of the food (i.e. dairy, gluten, ect.)


Note to making diabetic friendly foods!
Basically healthy eating. High-fiber options(slow release carbs)


So, for example, if the IsSoyFree field returns a 1 then that food DOESN'T have soy in it; because IsSoyFree=true.
