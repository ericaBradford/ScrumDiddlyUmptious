Describing a many-to-many relationship. This means we will need a junction table that holds the relationships. I will directly cut and paste their example and change it to how it would work for this project.
“Each Recipe is associated with one or more IngredientRecipeMapping.”
“Each IngredientRecipeMapping is associated with one and only one Recipe.”
“Each IngredientRecipeMapping is associated with one or more Ingredients.”
“Each Ingredient is associated with zero or more IngredientRecipeMapping.”
From here I will do a more-correct ORM diagram. This will be diagram v2.
