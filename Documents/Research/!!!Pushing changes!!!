*git add .
*git commit -m 'message'
*git push origin nameOfBranchHere
-------------------------------------------------

time to switch branches?
First commit to your branch. Then...
*git checkout master
*git merge branchName
*git push origin master
*git checkout -b 'newBranch'
*git push origin 'newBranch'

----------------------------------------------

checkout just changes what is in your local copy. You have to push the changes as well. Merging apparantly also only works on your local copy. So push that to.
