Quick list of all branch commands

# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature master

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"

# Merge in the new-feature branch
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature



3-Way Merge

The next example is very similar, but requires a 3-way merge because master progresses while the feature is in-progress. This is a common scenario for large features or when several developers are working on a project simultaneously.

# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature master

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"

# Develop the master branch
git checkout master

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Make some super-stable changes to master"

# Merge in the new-feature branch
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
